The main programs to be run are implemented in the lcs_parallel.c and lcs_sequential.c 

The functions used in the driver programs are implemented in the other files.

The input of the two sequences are specified in the files file1.txt and file2.txt. Feel free to modify them as you please.

The results of running the program are pushed to the external file results.txt. View this file after execution of both the sequential and the parallel programs.



Yours sincerely,

The Avengers.
